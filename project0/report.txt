REPORT:

This file contains a brief summary of cogent details regarding 
Project 0 and the code I've written for it.

Point 1 - Warnings
Multiple warnings appear when independently compiling object files for
date.c and tldlist.c due to their use of functions from stdlib.h and 
string.h - both of which are included in tldmonitor.h and thus can be
referenced. Normally I'd add them to the headers, but we're not supposed
to edit those. Hence the warnings.

Point 2 - Undefined Behavior
The Date mechanics sanitize for syntax, but do not check if the 
actual values of the dates are valid - ie, that they are real and
can be found on a calendar, or that they are actually digits.

Point 3 - Implementation
I'm not happy with how I handled date creation and want to replace
it with memcpy, but might not have the time. The AVL tree is coming down
to the wire.
