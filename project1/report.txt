REPORT:

This file contains a brief summary of cogent details regarding
Project 1 and the code I've written for it. 

USPSv1:

As far as I can tell, this functions fine. GDB and Valgrind
report no issues with it. I'm not happy with how complicated
the main function is. Were I redoing the project, I would
(among many, MANY other things) break it apart some. 

USPSv2:

Currently the final version (I *know*), there is only one major
issue that I can identify but not correct. While both GDB and 
Valgrind report no problems, executing the program results in an
inexplicable number of orphaned and zombie processes - even though
fork() is never called more than the number of child processes AND
all those child processes complete. It's baffling. Probably to do 
with that thrice-damned 16-hour-in-making SIGUSR1 pause-everything
nonsense at the very start.

USPSv3:

WIP

USPSv4:

N/A.

Overall:

On the one hand, I flubbed this badly. I left it too long and 
let midterms week blind me to the fact that this project was due 
immediately after. I remember trying to work on it earlier, but 
chose to put it off because we hadn't covered processes at the
time. I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. I'm sorry. 

On the other hand. I'm taking four 400-level CIS courses in the 
same quarter and fighting chronic insomnia on top of that. My 
circadian rhythm is a bad joke at this point. I'd ask for leniency
in light of that, but I think I already know the answer. I'll figure 
something out. 

But really. Monday after the midterm? What were you expecting? God,
I hope the curve saves me.
